# Groupie Tracker

## Project Overview

Groupie Tracker is a web application that retrieves and visualizes data about artists, bands, their locations, and concert dates from a provided API.

## Objectives

The project aims to:
- Receive and manipulate data from a multi-part API
- Create a user-friendly website to display band information
- Implement various data visualization techniques
- Demonstrate client-server communication
- Develop event-driven features

## API Structure

The API contains four main components:
1. **Artists**: 
   - Band/artist names
   - Images
   - Year of activity start
   - First album date
   - Band members

2. **Locations**: 
   - Last and upcoming concert locations

3. **Dates**: 
   - Last and upcoming concert dates

4. **Relation**: 
   - Links between artists, dates, and locations
